# SFML-Game
2D game using the SFML library 

The SFML (Simple and Fast Multmedia Library) provides a simple interface and a set of functions that can be used for game design/multimedia applications.
This project follows the approach of the book "SFML Game Development" by Moreira, Hansson, and Haller.
